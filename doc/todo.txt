Meeting: 1/21
	* Add "related events" using a [self-join association](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#self-joins)
	* Add related acts to the acts table

Later:
	* Upcoming events should display next two weeks. And a link to show more (shows another two weeks each time)
	* Implement search ability.
	* Acts and Venues Index pages, Should have a class or ID for each item, which can be be hidden/shown via javascript
	* Long strings should be rendered with ... instead of wrapping.

Issues:

Main Page:

	Logos: Generate the logo name from the Act/event/venue name. Instead of hard coding it in the database. Then we can drop the logo column.
	The logo would be <name>-logo.png, and there is some Rails text helper to convert spaces to dashes. If the logo is not found, we should use the default logo. 
	Or the default logo for the class.

	Find out how we can access or use location services on the iPhone.

	Find out how to hide the google search in the browser on iPhone. Or maybe use it, to search our site instead of the web.

Event Show Page Issues:

	We want special events(only) to include the venue and location for each performance in the performance list.

Act Show page Issues:

Venue Show Page Issues:

	1) Under the upcoming events at that venue section for a special event it lists all the bands playing at that venue for that special event, but there is only one date and time.  For this I would eliminate the acts displayed and make the date and time the occurrence start and end time.  Might need to show the date for both start and end since it would be multi-day.  We can play with the display until we like it.

	2) On the upcoming events, for special events ONLY we should remove the list of acts from the event block. And add for any event over 24 hours, include start and stop dates and times. Add the time to the end of the date string. Thursday, September 22, 2011, 9:40p

What if:

	What if we had a concept of scheduleable, and acts were schedulable. As are other things like drink specials.
	The schedulable table would have the start and stop times, and it would have a link to a location, and an event

	Events become just place holders for names and descriptions.

	Finally, the schedulable table could have a list of sponsors

	A "special" event is just any event that lasts more than 24 hours, or which has too many performances, for some value of "too many"

DONE
	* Add Edit|Add buttons to the top right of the page
	* Events do not need all the different weblinks they should be linkable.
	* Venues should be linkable too.
	* Need cover charge added to upcoming events both regular and special events.
	* Remove space between time and am or pm and remove m from am and pm so it displays as a or p.
	* truncation is working If we can't get truncation to work on long lines (...), can we get them to wrap?
	* This could be an issue on all show pages.  We need a character limit to the description area.  When the limit is reached it will cut off the description with a â€¦ and then have a link that says show more.  Clicking the show more link expands the description area and shows the entire description which now ends with a show less link that would close the description back up and restore the default state.
